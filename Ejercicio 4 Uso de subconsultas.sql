--- Ejercicio 4: Uso de subconsultas

--- Use simple subqueries
    --- A subquery is a query that is nested within another query. The subquery is often referred to as the inner query, 
    --- and the query within which it is nested is referred to as the outer query.

--- the highest price for which any individual product has been sold
SELECT MAX(UnitPrice) AS MAX
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail;

-- Modify the query as follows to use the query you just ran as a subquery in an outer query that retrieves products with a ListPrice higher than the maximum selling price.
SELECT Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ListPrice >
    (SELECT MAX(UnitPrice)
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail);
-- which include all products that have a listPrice that is higher than the maximum price for which any product has been sold.

-- the ProductID for each product that has been ordered in quantities of 20 or more
SELECT DISTINCT ProductID
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail
WHERE OrderQty >= 20;

-- Modify the query as follows to use it in a subquery that finds the names of the products that have been ordered in quantities of 20 or more.
SELECT Name
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductID IN
    (SELECT DISTINCT ProductID
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail
    WHERE OrderQty >= 20);
-- note that it returns the product names.

-- use the JOIN to obtain the same result
SELECT DISTINCT Name
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS o
    ON p.ProductID = o.ProductID
WHERE OrderQty >= 20;
-- In most cases, the performance of equivalent join or subquery operations is similar, but in some cases where existence checks need to be performed, joins perform better.

-- Use correlated subqueries
    -- So far, the subqueries weâ€™ve used have been independent of the outer query. In some cases, you might need to use an inner subquery that references a value 
    -- in the outer query. Conceptually, the inner query runs once for each row returned by the outer query (which is why correlated subqueries are sometimes referred 
    -- to as repeating subqueries).

-- note that the results contain the order ID, product ID, and quantity for each sale of a product.
SELECT od.SalesOrderID, od.ProductID, od.OrderQty
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
ORDER BY od.ProductID;

-- Modify the query as follows to filter it using a subquery in the WHERE clause that retrieves the maximum purchased quantity for each product retrieved by the outer query. 
-- Note that the inner query references a table alias that is declared in the outer query.
SELECT od.SalesOrderID, od.ProductID, od.OrderQty
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
WHERE od.OrderQty =
    (SELECT MAX(OrderQty)
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS d
    WHERE od.ProductID = d.ProductID)
ORDER BY od.ProductID
-- which should only contain product order records for which the quantity ordered is the maximum ordered for that product.

-- note that it returns the order ID, order date, and customer ID for each order that has been placed.
SELECT o.SalesOrderID, o.OrderDate, o.CustomerID
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS o
ORDER BY o.SalesOrderID;

-- Modify the query as follows to retrieve the company name for each customer using a correlated subquery in the SELECT clause.
SELECT o.SalesOrderID, o.OrderDate,
    (SELECT CompanyName
    FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
    WHERE c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID) AS CompanyName
FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS o
ORDER BY o.SalesOrderID;
-- the company name is returned for each customer found by the outer query.

-- CHALLENGES

-- Challenge 1: Retrieve product price information
-- Adventure Works products each have a standard cost price that indicates the cost of manufacturing the product, and a list price that indicates the recommended selling 
-- price for the product. This data is stored in the SalesLT.Product table. Whenever a product is ordered, the actual unit price at which it was sold is also recorded 
-- in the SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail table. You must use subqueries to compare the cost and list prices for each product with the unit prices charged in each sale.

    -- 1. Retrieve products whose list price is higher than the average unit price.
	    -- Retrieve the product ID, name, and list price for each product where the list price is higher than the average unit price for all products that have been sold.
        -- Tip: Use the AVG function to retrieve an average value.

SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ListPrice >
    (SELECT AVG(UnitPrice)
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail)
ORDER BY ListPrice

    -- 2. Retrieve Products with a list price of 100 or more that have been sold for less than 100.
		-- Retrieve the product ID, name, and list price for each product where the list price is 100 or more, and the product has been sold for less than 100.

SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product
WHERE ProductID IN
    (SELECT ProductID
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail
    WHERE UnitPrice <100.00)
ORDER BY ListPrice DESC

-- Challenge 2: Analyze profitability
-- The standard cost of a product and the unit price at which it is sold determine its profitability. You must use correlated subqueries to compare the cost 
-- and average selling price for each product.

    -- 1. Retrieve the cost, list price, and average selling price for each product
        -- Retrieve the product ID, name, cost, and list price for each product along with the average unit price for which that product has been sold.

SELECT p.ProductID, p.Name, p.StandardCost AS Cost, p.ListPrice,
    (SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) 
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
    WHERE od.ProductID = p.ProductID) AS UnitPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
ORDER BY Cost

    -- 2. Retrieve products that have an average selling price that is lower than the cost.
        -- Filter your previous query to include only products where the cost price is higher than the average selling price.

SELECT p.ProductID, p.Name, p.StandardCost, p.ListPrice,
    (SELECT AVG(UnitPrice) 
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS o
    WHERE o.ProductID = p.ProductID) AS UnitPrice
FROM SalesLT.Product AS p
WHERE StandardCost > 
    (SELECT AVG(od.UnitPrice)
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderDetail AS od
    WHERE od.ProductID = p.ProductID)
ORDER BY StandardCost
